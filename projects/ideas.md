# Project Ideas

- Aiming at learning how to make advanced Mongo queries:
  - Some sort of search engine?
  - Some tool that translates SQL into Mongo queries?
  - Would be nice to implement some searching algorithm, e.g: Google's page rank ...
  - How about searching over the Bible ??

- Aiming at learning how to use GraphQL:
  - Proxy to PokeAPI.

- Implement a GraphQL API Server that serves as proxy to all my other side projects:
   * The server and the services (side projects) will communicate using gRPC.
   * The clients of the API Server could be anything (CLI, APIs, GUIs, ...)
   * Implement some authentication and authorization mechanism.

- Make performance testing fun:
   * Create a video game that would allow you to:
   * Create a script by planning an "invasion";
   * Represent services as fortresses;
   * Constantly monitor services and show that as the health of the fortress;
   * Represent threads as multiple warriors/ships/guns/...;
   * Connect to a different server and execute the script;
   * Communicate constantly to check if the script failed/finished/...;
   * Execute distributedly as multiple armies/...;
   * View interactions between these warrios/ships and fortresses when the script starts;

- Use the New Relic student license to monitor all the services you've created:
   * [Node.js](https://newrelic.com/blog/best-practices/nodejs-application-monitoring)

- Create my own blockchain to fully understand how it works. Try using go.

- Contribute to the project containerd.

- Create an app that would map pencil strokes in your Galaxy tab to mouse interactions in your computer (for Linux, PC, and Tablet)
