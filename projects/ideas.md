# Project Ideas

- Aiming at learning how to make advanced Mongo queries:
  - Some sort of search engine?
  - Some tool that translates SQL into Mongo queries?
  - Would be nice to implement some searching algorithm, e.g: Google's page rank ...
  - How about searching over the Bible ??

- Aiming at learning how to use GraphQL:
  - Proxy to PokeAPI.

- Implement a GraphQL API Server that serves as proxy to all my other side projects:
   * The server and the services (side projects) will communicate using gRPC.
   * The clients of the API Server could be anything (CLI, APIs, GUIs, ...)
   * Implement some authentication and authorization mechanism.
