## About Me

I'm a software engineer passionate for acquiring a deep understanding of technology and use
that understanding to solve complex and interesting problems. I have 1+ year of experience
testing REST APIs, websites, and event driven architectures using JMeter, Python, and Sitespeed.
I love nature and hip-hop music.
